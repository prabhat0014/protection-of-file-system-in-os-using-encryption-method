Key areas that need security measures in operataing system:
- User Accounts
- Account Policies
- File System
- Network Services

### OBJECTIVES
- Understanding the need of data security and integrity to be included during design of distributed operating system.
- Types of cryptography modules used by different operating system store data and authorize users.
- Implement a file encryption technique using DES for the windows platform.
- Comparing the time and space aspects of decrypted file and encrypted file.

### SCOPE
- First, the user completes the agreement form of the program and then the user either files a text message or files a text message.
- Encryption key as input as a result, the program will encrypt and decrypt the text message and save it to a file
